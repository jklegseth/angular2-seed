# angular2-seed
Mostly for my own quick-start Angular 2 projects, this is a bare bones starter that I will keep updated through all release candidates (currently rc.5) until officially released. This is basically the seed you will find in the official docs ["5 Min Quickstart"](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html).

## Installation
Clone or download zip to a new directory.

From the directory root run `npm install`. Note that on Mac you will likely need to use `sudo npm install`.

However, this usually fails due to `typings` not installing properly, so the more sure way to install is: `sudo npm install && sudo npm run typings install`.

Run the app with `npm start`. See [official docs](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/) for everything else.
